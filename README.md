# Email-Spam-Classifier
This project aims to implement an email spam filter using a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier. Our classifier will identify and filter out spam based on word frequencies and patterns that are most often associated with unwanted emails.

# Email Spam Classifier

This project implements an email spam classifier using machine learning techniques. The classifier is built using Python and utilizes libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `nltk` for data processing and model training.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- You have `pip` (Python package manager) installed. It usually comes with Python installations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
(Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username or the relevant repository link.)

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment for Python projects. You can create one using the following commands:

bash

Edit
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
.venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages: Use the requirements.txt file to install the necessary libraries:

bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset: Ensure you have a dataset of emails organized into ham (non-spam) and spam directories. Each directory should contain text files of emails.

The dataset structure should look like this:

Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
dataset/
├── ham/
│   ├── email1.txt
│   ├── email2.txt
│   └── ...
└── spam/
    ├── email1.txt
    ├── email2.txt
    └── ...
Run the email preprocessor: Execute the email_preprocessor.py script to load and preprocess the emails:


python email_preprocessor.py
This script will generate a cleaned_emails.csv file containing the processed email data.

Vectorize the email data: After preprocessing, run the vectorize.py script to convert the email text into numerical format suitable for machine learning:

bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
python vectorize.py
This will create vectorized training and testing data files (X_train_vectorized.csv, X_test_vectorized.csv, y_train.csv, y_test.csv).

Train your model: (Optional) You can create a separate script to train a machine learning model using the vectorized data. This part is not included in the current setup but can be implemented based on your choice of algorithms.
